# Beyond the Diagnosis: Modeling Autism Prevalence with Purpose
This project explores the evolving landscape of autism diagnosis across the United States—bridging clinical traits, demographic disparities, and temporal dynamics to uncover how diagnostic systems reflect and shape access to care.
“The autism diagnosis is more than a statistic. It is a reflection of systems that shape recognition, environments that foster understanding, and communities that demand equity.”
